You must submit your code (see below) as well as a short (2 pages, maximum) writeup describing your approach. This writeup should:

Describe any design decisions you made, including your choice of deadlock detection.

Discuss and justify any changes you made to the API.

Describe any missing or incomplete elements of your code.

Describe how long you spent on the lab, and whether there was anything you found particularly difficult or confusing.

1. Exercise 1: Acquiring transaction locks in BufferPool

- I have implemented acquiring transaction locks in the `BufferPool` struct using `sync.Mutex`. As a data structure to track existing locks for each page, I used a map from pageKey to `PageLock`, which is a struct of `sharedTids` (set) and `exclusiveTid` (optional TransactionID), because a page can have multiple shared locks but at most one exclusive lock (also cannot have both shared and exclusive locks at the same time). Then, I added a logic at the beginning of `GetPage` that tries to acquire a lock for the page. This is done by repeating the following: first acquire the Mutex of the buffer pool, then check if the page lock can be acquired, then release the buffer pool Mutex, and break or block depending on whether the lock is acquired or not. One tricky part here was to consider the case where the transaction already has the lock for the page. In this case, depending on `RWPerm`, upgrade can happen, or the lock can be acquired immediately, or the transaction can be blocked.

2. Exercise 2: Implementing the `BeginTransaction()`, `CommitTransaction()`, and `AbortTransaction()` methods in `BufferPool`
- For `BeginTransaction()`, I added a field `runningTids` that tracks the running transactions, so that the function can raise an error if the transaction ID is already in the map.
- For `CommitTransaction()` and `AbortTransaction()`, they respectively flush or discard the pages that are marked as dirty by the transaction, and then release all associated locks through the common helper function `releaseLocks`.
- I additionally fixed `HeapFile`'s `InsertTuple` method to always get page from the buffer pool, even when the page is newly created, so that the buffer pool tracks dirty pages correctly.

3. Exercise 3: Adding synchronization
- I added a `Mutex mu` to the `HeapFile` struct, and locked & unlocked it before and after creating and flushing a new page in `InsertTuple` method (when all pages are full). This is to prevent a race condition where multiple transactions try to create a new page at the same time and overwrite each other's changes.

4. Exercise 4: Implementing NO STEAL
- I have implemented random eviction policy for buffer pool, which evicts a random page from the buffer pool that is "not dirty". If there is no non-dirty page, it will raise `BufferPoolFullError`. This ensures that my code correctly implements NO STEAL policy. 

5. Exercise 5: Implementing deadlock detection
- I choose to implement deadlock detection by maintaining a wait-for graph, and aborting a transaction that causes a cycle in the graph. I track the dependency graph by adding a field `waitFor` to the `BufferPool`, which is a map from `TransactionID` to a set of `TransactionID`s that the transaction is waiting for. The detailed logic for avoiding deadlock is as follows:
  - When a transaction tries to acquire a lock, in addition to checking if the lock can be acquired, I also create a set of transactions that the transaction is waiting for (if exists).
  - Then, if the lock cannot be acquired, I call `detectDeadlock` function, which updates the wait-for graph and checks if there is a cycle in the graph by running DFS.
  - If there is a cycle, I abort the current transaction so that other transactions can proceed.
  - Also I made sure to properly release the Mutex lock before calling other functions.
- There are both pros and cons of this deadlock detection method. The advantage is that it precisely detects the situation where a deadlock can occur based on the dependency graph, so will not abort transactions unnecessarily, and also resolves deadlocks immediately. Also, it is simple and straightforward compared to other methods that aim to gain more performance. The disadvantage is that the wait-for graph needs to be updated every time a transaction cannot acquire a lock, and DFS also needs to be run every time. This can be computationally expensive, especially when there are many transactions interleaved and the graph is large. Also, aborting the current transaction can lead to certain transactions being aborted again and again, due to their specific positions in the wait-for graph.
